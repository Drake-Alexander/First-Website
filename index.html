             <h4>About</h4>
             <span>Hello! After I started working for Costco in 2021 I become very interested in learning how to code after I started utilizing scripts for my day to day tasks.
               I started down an internet rabbit hole and now I have found myself here in the fascinating world of web dev.
             When not immersed in the digital realm, I spend most of my time enjoying the precious moments guiding my little ones through the quirks of life 
             and helping a pre-teen navigate the perplexities of growing up. I also enjoy hanging out with my beloved spouse and my furry four-legged friend 
             The family unit is the beating heart of my world where laughter and learning go hand in hand.   </span>
