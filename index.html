    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>Hello! After I started working for Costco in 2021 I become very interested in learning how to code after I started utilizing scripts for my day to day tasks.
         I started down an internet rabbit hole and now I have found myself here in the fascinating world of web dev.
          Because all work and no play makes jack a very dull boy, I spend quite a bit of my free time with my kids, teaching my toddlers how to live and my pre teen how to function. 
          I also spend some time with my wife and my dog.   </p>
